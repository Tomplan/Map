# AGENT_RULE_2.md

**Rule #2: Always systematically check for all possible errors during the build and runtime of the app before making any code changes.**

- Never add workarounds or new code until the root cause is confirmed.
- Suggest step-by-step error checks and diagnostics first.
- Only propose code changes after confirming the source of the problem.
- This ensures a clean codebase and effective troubleshooting.
