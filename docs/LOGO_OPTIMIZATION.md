# Logo optimization pipeline

This repository contains a small reproducible Node script to create optimized raster variants for logos (WebP + AVIF) so they are responsive and bandwidth-friendly.

Prerequisites
- Node 18+ and npm
- `sharp` requires libvips installed on your system (see https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/install)

Quick usage

1. Dry run locally (no uploads):

```bash
# install dependencies
npm ci

# generate variants for all files in public/assets/logos -> public/assets/logos/generated
npm run images:optimize-logos
```

2. Check that 128px webp variants exist for each logo (CI-friendly):

```bash
npm run images:check-logos
```

Notes
- The script copies originals to `public/assets/logos/originals/` and creates generated variants in `public/assets/logos/generated/`.
- For logos that are vector (SVG) or simple icon marks, consider converting to true SVG and keeping it in the repo. For photographic logos use raster variants generated by the script.

Next steps
- Add automated uploads to Supabase Storage or push generated files into a versioned asset path for CDN caching.
